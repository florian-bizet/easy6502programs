# easy6502programs
Programs i made in order to learn 6502 assembly language using [easy6502](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/simulator.html) architecture

**UPDATE** : I am now using [6502asm.com](http://www.6502asm.com/) to run my code. It emulates the same architecture but runs faster.

## Program list (sorted by chronological order) :
